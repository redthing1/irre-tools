THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW:

SEE:
```
sbi	sp	sp	#4
; loc_sz=4, rs_sz=0, ce_sz=-4
ldw	r1	sp	#-4
```

Here, we can see that the LDW is trying to load the first param in.
However, since the function lowered the stack frame at the prologue,
that LDW is now pointing somewhere invalid. (because we already lowered it 4, and it was stored 4 below sp, so now it's pointing 4 below where the variable was actually put)

SOLUTION?
